Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue (totalling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021. the world's most valuable company. As of
                    2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC vendor by unit sales, and fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.</p>

                    Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computer--a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer. the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor
                    chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.
